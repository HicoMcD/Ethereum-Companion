## Welcome to the AthensLab Ethereum Developer Companion

This website has been developed as a companion to the Consensys Blockchain Developer Bootcamp and is designed as a series of structured links and content, that when followed over four months, will provide you with the basic knowledge to develop decentralised applications.



## Learning Outcomes


By Following the Companion,  learners will be able to show evidence of:

1.Describe Blockchain primitives and basics and give examples for their usage.

2.Prepare and demonstrate setting up a development environment for Ethereum.

3.Compose basic Smart contracts and their tests and deploy them in a test environment.

4.Produce an evaluation of common security issues in smart contracts.

5.Build, Deploy and showcase a decentralised application on Ethereum.

Indicative Learner Workload: Minimum 10 hours per week, with at least 4 hours per week hands-on practice. / Recommended Learner Workload:
20 hours per week, with 10 hours per week devoted to hands-on practice. 5 hours per week, spent on theory, fundamentals and seminars.
